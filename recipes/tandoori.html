    <p>
        To prepare the Tandoori Chicken, start by making the marinade. In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, oil, and salt. If you have kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crush it and add to the marinade. Coat the chicken pieces well with the marinade and let it sit for at least 2 hours (or overnight for more flavor) in the refrigerator. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the marinated chicken on a baking rack and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Optionally, baste the chicken with oil or butter halfway through. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with naan, rice, or a side of salad.
